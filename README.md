### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a passion for open-source software development. I specialize in **low-level programming**, and I'm always looking for exciting new projects to contribute to. Don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any ideas or proposals.

I also have two brothers who are doing some cool things: [Adil](https://github.com/AdilZouitine) & [Mehdi](https://github.com/MehdiZouitine) ðŸ¤©.

Big fan of the Rust programming language ðŸ¦€

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to explore my repositories!
